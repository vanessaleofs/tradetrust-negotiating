        "question": "What is government’s role?",
        "answer": "We observed that industry players by themselves are already actively looking at ways to leverage innovative technologies to address inefficiencies of cross-border trade. At the same time, these companies also recognise the importance of a government-led initiative like TradeTrust that will tackle the problem at areas that are beyond them, like legal recognition and G2G mutual recognition. We need to work closely with the industry stakeholders on few areas: engagements for feedback, participation in standards development and the conduct of pilots."

      {
        "question": "What is the industry’s role?",
        "answer": "Industry buy-in and adoption across the supply chain is required in order to truly reap the benefits of paperless trade. As a trading transaction may involve many stakeholders, the buy-in from all parties to create the circle of trust to carry out paperless trade transactions is important."

        "question": "What are the main features of TradeTrust?",
        "answer": "<p>The v1 prototype is designed for notarisation of trade documents using open-source solution leveraging on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). This allows end users receiving the document to verify the provenance and integrity of the document. The use of such technology offers several advantages.</p><ol> <li>There is no proprietary lock-in; solution will be open-source which lowers barriers of entry to market </li> <li>There is no centralised infrastructure (governance/sovereignty); thus, there would not be any single entity in charge of the verification/data that eliminates the trust concern of which authority will have all the trade information in trade world especially when cross-border trading is involved</li> <li>Elevates automated trade document processing; allows for any parties in the supply chain to issue trade documents, and for anyone to quickly check the validity of a digital trade documents. This will in time make trade facilitation easier and smoother for the whole supply chain workflow</li> <li>Connecting the disconnected world (digital standard); allowing isolated eco-systems to be interoperable</li> </ol>"
